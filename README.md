 **NEMO ‚Äì Navigational Engine Using Marine Optimization**

 *Transforming Coastal Livelihoods with AI-Powered Precision Fishing*

---

 Problem

Coastal fishermen in Tamil Nadu face declining fish stocks, unpredictable weather, and high fuel costs. Fishing decisions are driven by generational intuition rather than actionable data ‚Äî leading to low yields, wasted trips, and financial vulnerability.



 Solution

**NEMO** is an AI-powered navigational assistant that uses real-time satellite data, historical fleet behavior, and marine regulations to recommend **high-yield, low-risk, and fuel-optimized fishing routes**, translated into spoken Tamil. Designed for zero-literacy, the platform offers intuitive audio and map guidance tailored to fishermen‚Äôs daily needs.

 Optimization Logic

1. **Input:**

   * Current location (`lat/lon`)
   * Fuel limit (converted to distance range)
   * Latest fleet `.csv` data

2. Process:

   * Generate 10km grid from current location
   * Score each grid using:

     * ML-predicted yield
     * Distance from current location
     * Exclusion if in risk zones

3. Selection:

   * Apply yield-to-fuel ratio optimization
   * Compute safest shortest route using NetworkX
   * Validate against marine boundary constraints

4. Output:

   * Map with markers and Tamil instructions
   * Route line from current to optimal point
   * Alerts: red markers for restricted zones

 Example: Use Case

> A fisherman from Nagapattinam opens the app with a 30 km fuel range.

* The app scans uploaded `.csv` of recent fleet data

* SST + chlorophyll pattern suggests zone 22 km east with a **yield score of 0.91**

* Tamil voice instruction:

  > ‚Äú‡ÆÆ‡ØÄ‡Æ©‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç ‡Æö‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ§‡Æ∞‡Æ∞‡Øá, ‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æö‡Øà‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ 22 ‡Æï‡Æø.‡ÆÆ‡ØÄ ‡Æ™‡ÆØ‡Æ£‡Æø‡ÆØ‡ØÅ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Øç. ‡ÆÖ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ© ‡ÆÆ‡ØÄ‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æµ‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ ‡Æâ‡Æ≥‡Øç‡Æ≥‡Æ§‡ØÅ.‚Äù

* He returns with 3√ó higher catch, avoiding poor yield zones and high-risk waters.
